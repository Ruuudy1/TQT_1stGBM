Here’s an overview of the open positions and our broader vision to expand TQT into the world of Fintech and Quantitative Finance:

Both Researcher and Specialist roles will contribute short-form research content—just one post to start. The goal of these positions is to establish an online presence of UC San Diego in Quantitative Finance and Fintech to bring us more opportunities and collaborations. By broadening our club up to fintech we get more exposure from ​San Diego's growing fintech sector leading to more internship opportunities from our online exposure.
Some notable fintech companies based in San Diego are: 
📊 Intuit (maker of TurboTax and QuickBooks)
💰 LPL Financial (#1 independent broker-dealer in the U.S.)
🏦 Axos Bank (digital bank offering financial services)
💹 Kyriba (SaaS treasury platform)

✅ Contributors will be credited and tagged in each post, giving them the option to share the content on their own networks. This creates a mutually beneficial platform: TQT expands its reach while students build a public portfolio of research and domain expertise. A Win-win for both parties 🙂

💼 We want this to be a valuable experience you can proudly include on your resume or LinkedIn under your experience section—something that aligns with and strengthens your broader career goals. While we’ve outlined specific research areas, nothing is set in stone. If you have expertise in a field or topic that isn’t listed and you believe it can have a strong relevance to quantitative finance or fintech, feel free to reach out to me. We’re happy to collaborate with you on a custom title that better reflects your strengths and helps position you for future opportunities.

⭐ Specialists, apart from short form posts, will also be asked to give one seminar per quarter (roughly 45 min to 1 hour) on any topic you’re passionate about. This can even be an expansion of your short-form post. To soothe the workload, seminars may be presented in groups of up to 3 people

That said—if public speaking isn’t your thing, no worries. Although we would prefer seminars/workshops, Instead, you can opt to create long-form written content: a deep dive into a topic of your choice with clear examples, insights, and a small code demo. I’ve pitched this structure to the CEO of QuantConnect, and we’ll be able to publish strong pieces on their official research blog—giving your work industry-level exposure.

🚀 If you’re interested in joining or just want to see examples of the post formats, DM me and I’ll add you to our new Slack channel!
